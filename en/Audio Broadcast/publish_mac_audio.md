# Publish and Subscribe to Streams
Before publishing or subscribing to any stream, ensure that you prepared the development environment and joined the channel. See [Integrate the SDK](../../en/Voice/mac_video.md).

## Implementation
The audio function of the Agora SDK for macOS is enabled by default. Users can subscribe to and publish audio streams without calling any other API methods once they have joined the channel.

## Next Steps
You are in a voice call. When the call ends, use the Agora SDK to exit the current call:

* [Leave the Channel](../../en/Voice/leave_mac.md)

For more functions, you can refer to the following sections:

* [Adjust the Volume](../../en/Voice/volume_mac.md)
* [Play the Audio Effects/Audio Mixing](../../en/Voice/effect_mixing_mac.md)
* [Adjust the Pitch and Tone](../../en/Voice/voice_effect_android_audio.md)
