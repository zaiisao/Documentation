# Set up Authentication
To ensure communication security, when users join an RTC channel or you start recording on the server, Agora needs to check their authentication information. Agora provides three authentication mechanisms. According to your scenarios, you can choose one of the following mechanisms:

| Authentication mechanisms                          | Scenarios                                                    |
| :------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use an App ID for authentication                   | Scenarios with low security requirements                     |
| Use a token for authentication                     | Scenarios with high security requirements                    |
| Use either an App ID or a token for authentication | Scenarios in which you need to upgrade your projects to use token authentication |

<div class="alert warning">To raise the security level, Agora is phasing out the support for the App ID authentication mechanism. Agora recommends upgrading all your projects to use tokens for authentication.</div>


## <a name = "appid"></a>Use an App ID for authentication

After signing up for a developer account in [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io/), you can create multiple projects. Each project has an App ID, which is the unique identity of the project. If others steal your App ID, they can use it in their own projects. Therefore, using an App ID for authentication is less secure. Agora recommends using an App ID for authentication only in a test environment, or if your project has low security requirements.

<div class="alert warning">To raise the security level, Agora is phasing out the support for the App ID authentication mechanism. Agora recommends upgrading all your projects to use tokens for authentication. To avoid the impact on your projects, you can upgrade your project to <a href="#appid_token">use either an App ID or a token for authentication</a >.</div>

<a name = "getappid"></a>To get an App ID, do the following:

1. Sign up for a developer account at Agora Console. See [Sign up for an Agora account](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/sign_in_and_sign_up).

2. Click ![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1551254998344) in the left navigation menu to enter the [Project Management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page.

3. Click **Create**.

4. Enter your project name, choose the **App ID** authentication mechanism in the dialog box, and click **Submit**.

5. When the project is created successfully, you can see the newly created project in the project list. Click ![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1592488399929) to view and copy the App ID.

  ![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1574924570426)

6. You may need to enter the App ID when you call an API of an Agora project, such as initializing the SDK.

7. If you need to use a token for authentication, click **Edit** and enter the **Edit Project** page to enable an app certificate.

   <div class="alert note"><b>No certificate</b> means that your project uses only the App ID for authentication. <b>No certificate</b> appears only if you choose the <b>APP ID</b> authentication mechanism when creating a project.</div>

   ![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1592535218973)

## <a name = "Token"></a>Use a token for authentication

Token is a dynamic key generated by App ID, App Certificate, user ID, channel name, token expiration timestamp, and other information. For scenarios requiring high-security, such as the production environment, Agora recommends using a token for authentication.

### Scope of application

The following table lists Agora products which support tokens for authentication:

| Products                      | Versions of products which support tokens | Methods for getting SDK version |
| :---------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| Voice or Video SDK (Native)   | v2.1.0 or later                           | `getSdkVersion`                 |
| Voice or Video SDK (Web)      | v2.4.0 or later                           | `AgoraRTC.VERSION`              |
| Voice or Video SDK (Electron) | All versions                              | `getVersion`                    |
| Voice or Video SDK (Unity)    | All versions                              | `GetSdkVersion`                 |
| On-premise Recording SDK      | v2.1.0 or later                           | /                               |
| Cloud Recording               | All versions                              | /                               |
| Interactive Gaming SDK        | v2.2.0 or later                           | `getVersion`                    |

If you use an Agora product of a version earlier than mentioned above, you can upgrade your product version or use [Channel Keys](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/channel_key) for authentication. If you upgrade your product from a version that supports channel keys to a version that supports tokens, please refer to [Token Migration Guide](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/token_migration).

### Generate a token

You need to generate a token on your server. Follow the steps below to get the App ID, enable App Certificate, and call an API to generate a token.

**1. Get an App ID**

See [Get an App ID](#getappid).

**<a name = "appcertificate"></a>2. Enable an App Certificate**

An App Certificate is a string generated from Agora Console, and it enables token authentication. For different security requirements, Agora provides two types of app certificates. The differences are as follows:

- Primary certificate: You can use a primary certificate to generate tokens, including temporary tokens. You cannot delete a primary certificate.
- Secondary certificate: You can use a secondary certificate to generate tokens, except for temporary tokens. After enabling a secondary certificate, you can swap it for a primary certificate, or delete it.

If you enable an app certificate for the first time, you need to enable a primary certificate first.

To enable a primary certificate, do the following:

- If you choose the **APP ID + APP Certificate + Token** authentication mechanism when creating a project, Agora enables the primary certificate for you by default. On the **Edit Project** page, you can click ![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1592488399929) to view and copy the primary certificate.

 ![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1592535534341)

- If you choose the **APP ID** authentication mechanism when creating a project, you need to enable the primary certificate manually. On the **Edit Project** page, find **Primary certificate** and click **Enable**. Once the primary certificate is enabled, you can click ![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1592488399929) to view and copy the primary certificate, and use either an App ID or the token generated by the primary certificate for authentication. 

  ![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1592535218973)

**3.** **Generate a token**


- <a name = "get-a-temporary-token"></a>To facilitate authentication at the test stage, Agora Console provides temporary tokens. Click **Generate a temporary token** to see how to generate a temporary token:

 <details>
	<summary><font color="#3ab7f8">Generate a temporary token</font></summary>
	
	<div class="alert note"><li>Ensure that you have enabled a primary certificate before generating a temporary token. See <a href="#appcertificate">Enable a primary app certificate</a >.<li>A temporary token applies to scenarios requiring low security. Agora recommends using a token generated on your server for production environment.<li>A temporary token does not apply to the Agora RTM SDK.</li></div>
	
	On the <b>Project Management</b> page, find the project for which you want to generate a temporary token, and click ![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1574923151660).

 ![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1574927794840)

 On the <b>Token</b> page, enter the name of the channel that you want to join, and click <b>Generate Temp Token</b> to get a temporary token.

</details>
  
- <a name = "generatetoken"></a>For production environment, Agora recommends generating a token at your server by calling `buildTokenWithUid`. See [Generate a token](https://docs.agora.io/en/Audio%20Broadcast/token_server_cpp).

<div class="alert note"><li>Agora supports C++, Java, Python, PHP and other languages for generating tokens on your server. In this section, take the C++ language as an example.<li>The token encoding uses the standard HMAC/SHA1 approach and the libraries are available on common server-side development platforms, such as Node.js, Java, PHP, Python, and C++. For more information, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code">Authentication code</a >.</li></div>

  Sample code

 ```c++
	static std::string buildTokenWithUid(
        const std::string& appId,
        const std::string& appCertificate,
        const std::string& channelName,
        uint32_t uid,
        UserRole role,
        uint32_t privilegeExpiredTs = 0);
```

  | Parameters         | Descriptions                                                 |
  | :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
  | appId              | The App ID of your project.                                  |
  | appCertificate     | The app certificate of your project.                         |
  | channelName        | Unique channel name for the Agora RTC session in the string format. The string length must be less than 64 bytes. Supported character scopes are:<li>The 26 lowercase English letters: a to z.<li>The 26 uppercase English letters: A to Z.<li>The 10 digits: 0 to 9.<li>The space.<li>"!", "#", "$", "%", "&", "(", ")", "+", "-", ":", ";", "<", "=", ".", ">", "?", "@", "[", "]", "^", "_", " {", "}", "\|", "~", ",".</li> |
  | uid                | The user ID, a 32-bit unsigned integer.                      |
  | role               | The user role. Agora supports only one user role. Set the value as the default value `Role_Publisher = 1`. |
  | privilegeExpiredTs | Expiration time of the token. A Unix timestamp, represented by the number of seconds elapsed since 1/1/1970. For example, if you set this parameter as the current timestamp + 600 seconds, the token expires 10 minutes after it is generated. A token is valid for 24 hours at most. If you set this parameter as 0 or a period longer than 24 hours, the token is valid for 24 hours. |

  We provide an open source [Agora Dynamic Key](https://github.com/AgoraIO/Tools/tree/master/DynamicKey/AgoraDynamicKey) repository on GitHub, which covers developer languages such as C++, C#, Go, Java, Node.js, Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby. You can choose a language according to your development environment, and view the source code in the `src` folder or the sample code in the `sample` folder.

**4. Switch and delete the primary certificate**

After enabling a primary certificate, you can enable a secondary certificate. if the primary certificate is exposed to security risks, you can swap the secondary certificate for the primary certificate and delete the original primary certificate.

To switch and delete the primary app certificate, do the following:

1. On the **Edit Project** page, find **Secondary certificate**, and click **Enable**. After successfully enabling a secondary certificate, users can use either the primary certificate or the secondary certificate to generate tokens for authentication.
  ![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1592536905533)
2.  Click **Set as primary** to switch the secondary certificate and the primary certificate. Once you switch the primary certificate to the secondary certificate, all temporary tokens generated by the original primary certificate become invalid.
   ![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1592536920087)
3. Click **Delete** to delete the original primary certificate. You cannot restore the deleted certificate, and all tokens generated by the original primary certificate become invalid. You need to use the new primary certificate to generate tokens for authentication.
4. After deletion, the status of the secondary certificate becomes **Disabled**. A new secondary certificate is generated when you click **Enable** next time.

### Use the token

After generating a token, see the following steps to use the token:

1. When a client app calls an Agora API for certain functions, such as joining a channel, the client app needs to fill in the generated token, the user name, the channel name, and other information.
2. After the Agora server receives the token and other information, it authenticates the user's identity and decides if the user have the permission to join the channel. If the authentication is passed, the user can successfully join the channel and use the Agora services.
3. Token has expiration time. Once the token expires, it becomes invalid, and you need to generate a new token on your app server. Use the new token for joining a channel or using the Agora services.


## <a name="appid_token"></a>Use either an App ID or a token for authentication

<div class="alert warning">To raise the security level, Agora is phasing out the support for the App ID authentication mechanism. Agora recommends upgrading all your projects to use tokens for authentication.</div>

If you only use the App ID for authentication, you can follow the steps below for upgrading your project to use either an App ID or a token for authentication:

1. [Enable a primary app certificate](#appcertificate). 

2. After successfully enabling a primary app certificate, use the primary app certificate to [generate a token](https://docs.agora.io/en/Audio%20Broadcast/token_server_cpp).

3. Use either an App ID or a token for authentication. For example, when existing users are using App ID for authentication, new users can use a token for authentication, and thus both new and old users can join the same channel. You can gradually phase out the use of App ID for authentication.
 ![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1593500372631)
4. After all users switch to using a token for authentication, Agora recommends deleting **No certificate**.

	<div class="alert warning">Once you delete <b>No certificate</b>, you can no longer use the App ID for authentication, and the project cannot enable <b>No certificate</b> again.</div>
