# Peer-to-peer or Channel Messaging
This page describes how to integrate the Agora RTM Web SDK and call the basic functionalities.

## Integrate the SDK

### Direct `<script>` include

Download the Agora RTM Web SDK and include with a `<script>` tag, and `AgoraRTM` is registered as a global variable.

Add to the HTML file the following code and replace `/path/to/agora-rtm-sdk.min.js` with the URL of `agora-rtm-sdk.min.js`:

```html
<script src="/path/to/agora-rtm-sdk.min.js"></script>
```

> Ensure that the address specified by `src` is accessible as a URL in a web browser.

#### Use the TypeScript definition file (`AgoraRTM.d.ts`) to enable IntelliSense

After getting the global `AgoraRTM` object using Direct `<script>` Include, you can use it in the rest of your JavaScript code, but you cannot enable IntelliSense.
To enable IntelliSense, add the following annotation at the beginning of the JavaScript and replace `path/to/AgoraRTM.d.ts` with the actual directory holding the `AgoraRTM.d.ts` file:

```JavaScript
/// <reference path="path/to/AgoraRTM.d.ts" />
```



## Initialize the Client

### Create an Instance

Before logging in the Agora RTM system, call the [createInstance](https://docs.agora.io/en/Real-time-Messaging/API%20Reference/RTM_web/modules/agorartm.html#createinstance) method to create an [RtmClient](https://docs.agora.io/en/Real-time-Messaging/API%20Reference/RTM_web/classes/rtmclient.html) instance.

```JavaScript
import AgoraRTM from 'agora-rtm-sdk';
const client = AgoraRTM.createInstance('YourAppId'); 
```
> Only RTM instances with the same App ID can talk to each other.

### Set a listener to the connection state change 

By listening to the [ConnectionStateChanged](https://docs.agora.io/en/Real-time-Messaging/API%20Reference/RTM_web/interfaces/rtmclientevents.html#connectionstatechange) event on [RtmClient](https://docs.agora.io/en/Real-time-Messaging/API%20Reference/RTM_web/classes/rtmclient.html), you can be notified of connection state changes between the SDK and the Agora RTM server. 

```JavaScript
client.on('ConnectionStateChange', (newState, reason) => {
  console.log('on connection state changed to ' + newState + ' reason: ' + reason);
});
```

## Log in and log out

### Log in the Agora RTM system

A Web application can call the messaging functionalities of the Agora RTM system only after logging in the Agora RTM system.

To log in the Agora RTM system, pass an object with the following attributes:
- `token`: You can skip it or set it as null at development stages that do not demand high security, or pass in your token generated by your app server in situations that require high security. 
- `uid`: The User ID has to be a string of less than 64 visible characters. It cannot be set as null. 

The [login](https://docs.agora.io/en/Real-time-Messaging/API%20Reference/RTM_web/classes/rtmclient.html#login) method returns a Promise. Use the `then` method of this Promise for passing in a callback. Use the `catch` method for catching and handling exceptions. 

```JavaScript
client.login({ token: '<TOKEN>', uid: '<UID>' }).then(() => {
  console.log('AgoraRTM client login success');
}).catch(err => {
  console.log('AgoraRTM client login failure', err);
});
```

> The sample code above uses the `then/catch` method for passing callbacks and catching exceptions. 
> You can also use the ES7 `async/await` method for asynchronous SDK calls and the synchronous `try/catch` method for catching exceptions.  So does the rest of the asychronous APIs of Promise. 

### Log out the Agora RTM system

To log out the Agora RTM system, call the [logout](https://docs.agora.io/en/Real-time-Messaging/API%20Reference/RTM_web/classes/rtmclient.html#logout) method of [RtmClient](https://docs.agora.io/en/Real-time-Messaging/API%20Reference/RTM_web/classes/rtmclient.html).

```JavaScript
client.logout()
```



## Send or receive peer-to-peer messages

You can send and receive peer-to-peer messages after logging in Agora's RTM server.

### Send a peer-to-peer message

Call the [sendMessageToPeer](https://docs.agora.io/en/Real-time-Messaging/API%20Reference/RTM_web/classes/rtmclient.html#sendmessagetopeer) method of [RtmClient](https://docs.agora.io/en/Real-time-Messaging/API%20Reference/RTM_web/classes/rtmclient.html) to send a peer-to-peer message. You need to do the following:

- Pass the user ID of the intended receiver.
- Pass an [RtmMessage](https://docs.agora.io/en/Real-time-Messaging/API%20Reference/RTM_web/interfaces/rtmmessage.html) object.

This method returns a Promise:

- The *resolve* state of this Promise indicates whether the intended receiver receives the message.
- The *reject* state of this Promise indicates one of the following:
     - A timeout.
     - A rejection by the server.
     - A connection failure.

```JavaScript
client.sendMessageToPeer(
{ text: 'test peer message' }, // An RtmMessage object.
'demoPeerId', // The user ID of the remote user.
).then(sendResult => {
if (sendResult.hasPeerReceived) {
/* Your code for handling the event that the remote user receives the message. */
} else {
/* Your code for handling the event that the message is received by the server but the remote user cannot be reached. */
}
}).catch(error => {
/* Your code for handling the event of a message send failure. */
});
```

### Receive a peer-to-peer message

Set a listener to the [MessageFromPeer](https://docs.agora.io/en/Real-time-Messaging/API%20Reference/RTM_web/interfaces/rtmclientevents.html#messagefrompeer) event on [RtmClient](https://docs.agora.io/en/Real-time-Messaging/API%20Reference/RTM_web/classes/rtmclient.html) to receive a peer-to-peer message.

```JavaScript
client.on('MessageFromPeer', ({ text }, peerId) => { // text: text of the received message; peerId: User ID of the sender.
/* Your code for handling the event of receiving a peer-to-peer message. */
});
```

## Send or receive channel messages

### Create a channel

The following code snippet shows how to create a channel.

```JavaScript
const channel = client.createChannel('demoChannelName'); // Pass your channel ID here.
```

### Join a channel

The following code snippet shows how to join a channel. `channel` refers to the newly-created channel instance; each channel ID corresponds to a separate channel instance. 

```JavaScript
channel.join().then(() => {
/* Your code for handling the event of a join-channel success. */
}).catch(error => {
/* Your code for handling the event of a join-channel failure. */
});
```

### Send a channel message

You can send channel messages after joining a channel.

```JavaScript
channel.sendMessage({ text: 'test channel message' }).then(() => {
/* Your code for handling events, such as a channel message-send success. */
}).catch(error => {
/* Your code for handling events, such as a channel message-send failure. */
});
```

### Receive a channel message

```JavaScript
channel.on('ChannelMessage', ({ text }, senderId) => { // text: text of the received channel message; senderId: user ID of the sender.
/* Your code for handling events, such as receiving a channel message. */
});
```

### Set a listener to events, such as when a member joins or leaves the channel.

```JavaScript
channel.on('MemberJoined', memberId => { // memberId: user ID of the user joining the channel
/* Your code for handling events, such as when a member joins the channel. */
})
```

```JavaScript
channel.on('MemberLeft', memberId => { // memberId: user ID of the user joining the channel.
/* Your code for handling events, such as when a member leaves the channel. */
})
```
### Get the member list of the current channel

You can get the member list of the channel after joining it. Use the `getMembers` method. 

```JavaScript
channel.getMembers().then(membersList => { // membersList: The member list.
    /* You code for handling events, such as a getMembers success. */
}).catch(error => {
  /* Your code for handling events such as a getMembers failure. */
});
```

### Leave the channel

```JavaScript
channel.leave();
```
