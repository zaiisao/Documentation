# Billing, Fee Deduction, and Account Suspension
Agora Console issues billing information and deducts a fee from your account monthly. Note the actions that take place on the following dates:

- First day of each month: The release date. Agora Console issues your billing information by email.
- Sixth day of each month: The deduction date. Agora Console deducts the fee from your account and notifies you by email.
- Thirtieth day since the deduction date: The account suspension date. If your account balance remains negative, Agora suspends your account and notifies you by email. 

<div class="alert info"> None of the above applies if you have signed a contract with Agora. The contract overrides all finance information such as billing, deduction, and suspension details.</div>

## Billing

Agora Console issues billing information on the first day of each month. The billing period is for one calendar month.

Go to Agora Console, and click the **Finance** icon ![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1562666103550) on the left navigation panel. Click **Bills** to view the detailed billing information of your projects, including billing period, due date and amount.

## Fee Deduction

On the deduction date, Agora Console automatically deducts a fee for the previous month and notifies you by email. If your account balance is negative after the deduction, Agora sends you an email, reminding you to top up your account at your earliest convenience to avoid account suspension. 

## Account suspension

If your account balance is negative for 30 days since the deduction date, Agora suspends your account. Then none of your projects can access the Agora services. 

If this happens, please top up your account at your earliest convenience. Once your balance is greater than or equal to 0 , Agora unfreezes your account. 

<div class="alert note">Agora recommends that you upgrade to the post-payment mode by using one of the following methods:<ul><li>Add a credit card to your account or top up your account with a bank account.</li><li>Make a payment.</li><li>Sign a contract with Agora.</li></ul>If you do not upgrade to the post-payment mode, Agora will suspend your account immediately after your 10,000 charge-free minutes are fully deducted.</div>
