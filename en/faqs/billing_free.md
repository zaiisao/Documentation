# Agora's free-of-charge policy for the first 10,000 minutes
Agora gives each [Agora Account](https://console.agora.io/) 10,000 charge-free minutes each month, and deducts the minutes in the following sequence: 

1. Audio minutes
2. On-premise recording audio minutes
3. Cloud recording audio minutes 
4. HD video minutes
5. On-premise recording HD video minutes
6. Cloud recording HD video minutes
7. HD+ video minutes
8. On-premise recording HD+ video minutes
9. Cloud recording HD+ video minutes

If your total service minutes do not exceed 10,000 minutes, the service is free of charge. After the 10,000 charge-free minutes are fully deducted, Agora charges you for the additional service minutes.

<div class="alert note">The remaining free-of-charge minutes will be cleared at the end of each calendar month.</div>
